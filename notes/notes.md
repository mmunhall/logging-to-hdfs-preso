IDEA: START AT THE END!
=======================

















Design Goals
------------

* Reduce or eliminate completely the amount of log data stored on a filesystem,
* Reduce or eliminate the amount of file IO on a filesystem,
* Continue to allow logs to be written to the filesystem,
* Store all log data in Hadoop for analysis,
* Allow for old data to be purged,
* Provide an interface to monitor log data in near real time,
* Allow for the data to be analyzed programmatically (e.g. map/reduce, Spark, [insert buzzword])

Why this is a win/win for Canoe
-------------------------------

* We have a Hadoop environment.
* Our Hadoop environment is underutilized.
* Can run side-by-side with existing logging to disk.
* Very easy to implement with minimal changes to existing systems.
